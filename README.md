# trello-stickynotes
Trello based stickynotes.

This is a trello based stickynotes.

Implementing a trello client on linux as stickynotes.

-> Each board is a category in stickynotes
-> Each card is a note

Basically then we would be able to use trello as a stickynote 

#Current

As of now, I wish to implement this program on Electron and create a linux client.

Hopefully Trello has API's for this. If not, we would need to create a secure online datdabses... and then lot's of shit too.

I use indicator-stickynotes for my linux desktop.

I would like to modify it for trello synchronization.
